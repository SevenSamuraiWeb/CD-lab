Compute FIRST and FOLLOW sets for a context-free grammar.

The program expects the grammar in a text file where each production is on a
separate line using the format:

	NonTerminal -> production1 | production2 | ...

Symbols inside a production should be separated by whitespace. Epsilon may be
written as one of {ε, #, epsilon, EPSILON, lambda, Λ}. Lines starting with `//`
are treated as comments. The first production encountered determines the start
symbol, and the script prints the FIRST and FOLLOW sets for every non-terminal.
